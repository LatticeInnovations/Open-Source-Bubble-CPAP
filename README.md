# Open-Source-Bubble-CPAP
This is an open source Bubble CPAP project
# This document is the chronological archive of the open bubble CPAP Design. It shows the working principle of the CPAP system

> ## Iteration 1:

>> This is the first proposed design. It includes industrial grade as well as readily available off-the-shelf materials. 

>>It consists of the basic fundamental parts of the system. I.e.

>> - Air compressor
>> - Flow meter
>> - Humidifier
>> - PEEP bottle
>> - Nasal prong

> ## Iteration 2: 

>> Tests, observations and changes:

>> - Air compressor, alternative enclosure and hardware selection.
>> - Breathing circuit pressure validation: relation between PEEP submersion depth (cm), Flow rate(Lpm) and pressure (manometer reading)
>> - Pressure deviations between bubbling & non-bubbling humidifiers.
>> - Water filling and submersion depth control.

>> ### Iteration 2.0

>>> Gas detection (NH4, CO, CO2, Propane etc.) to identify the reason of smell inside the breathing circuit. 
>>> Effect on humidity with variable surface area inside the humidifier to control humidification.

>> ### Iteration 2.1

>>> Breathing circuit leakage detection technique and results

>> ### Iteration 2.2

>>> Load testing for 3 days & observations on stability of the in-circuit humidification irrespective of ambient temperature & humidity >>> change.

> ## Iteration 3:

>> - Comparison with Pumani and experiments on rebreathing of CO2 in Open bubble CPAP.
>> - Humidifier water filling mechanism with ball valve.
>> - Load testing with the new humidifier setup, continuous run for more than 8 hours
>> - Comparison between looped vs unidirectional (separate inspiratory & expiratory limb) nasal prongs usage

> ## Iteration 4: 

>> - Humidifier selection revised. Medical grade commonly available bottle shaped humidifiers. 
>> - Alternate silicone tubing for the breathing circuit. (ID-8mm, OD-12 mm)
>> - It has advantage of compatibility with a wide range of tube connectors.
>> - Oxygen blending feature addition in CPAP.
>> - 3-Flow-Meter method in contrast with existing pumani 2 FM design.
>> - Oxygen cylinder valve comparison and operating pressure levels selection.
